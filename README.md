# DataStructures
<div></div> 

### Constructed a PDF file regarding DataStructures according to interview point of view. I hope that if someone that doesn't find time to learn all these DataStructures or study them for their interview will definitely find it useful. P.S DataStructures make your code and application more robust, optimised and scalable.ðŸ˜‰ 
## As it is said:

#### The types of DataStructures discussed in this `DataStructures.pdf` file are as follows:

1. Big O Notation
2. Arrays
3. Linked Lists
4. Stacks
5. Queues
6. Hash Tables
7. Binary Trees
8. AVL Trees
9. Heaps
10. Tries
11. Graphs
12. Undirected Graphs
13. Sorting Algorithms
14. Searching Algorithms

#### Resources used:

Most of the time I learned these dataStructures from video tutorials of **"Mosh Hamedani"**, I also used **Google**, **docs.microsoft.com** and Ofcours as Google is mentioned, so you have guessed by now that from anywhere on the **Internet** I could learn.

#### Ending note:
I learnt, studied, understood and structured all the types of DataStructures into this PDF file so that those who are in a hurry and don't find time to watch all the videos again or go on the internet and study them one by one all over again. Through this file you can easily have a bird eye view on what's the role of each dataStructure and their importance in solving real life problems and making more scalabale and optimised applications. If you find any more to kindly, just add in the comments section and I'll try my best to add them too.
